# 🗡 Knives

## A Five-Player Trick-Taking Game

Knives is a five-player trick-taking game where players compete to collect coins (points on cards). Each hand, one player becomes the banker and secretly partners with a shadow banker. The other three players are defenders trying to stop them.


## The Deck (32 cards)

### Knives Suit (8 cards)
Ghost, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Ace (highest)

- Ace is highest, Ghost is lowest
- Knives are always **greater trump**

### Four Traditional Suits (24 cards)
Spades, Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts - each containing:

- Ghost, Special, Maid, Jack, Queen, King (highest)
- King is highest, Ghost is lowest
- Special cards rank between the Ghost and Maid

### Special Cards

- Cat of Clubs: Lead the next trick
- Dance of Diamonds: Swap a card with another player
- Hound of Hearts: Choose a player to reveal a card
- Snitch of Spades: Reveals a named card (except ghosts)


## Card Values (Coins)

- **Kings:** 3 coins each
- **Queens:** 2 coins each
- **Jacks:** 1 coin each
- **Ace of Knives:** 1 coin
- **All other cards:** 0 coins
- **Total in deck:** 25 coins


## Setup

1. Dealer shuffles and cards are cut
2. Deal 6 cards to each player (clockwise)
3. Deal 2 cards face-down to the bank
4. Dealer declares an initial strong suit (or declares “Knives only”)
5. Dealer rotates clockwise after each hand


## Choosing the Banker

Starting with the player left of the dealer, each player either:

- **Takes:** Becomes the banker with the current strong suit (if any)
- **Passes:** Names a new strong suit OR declares “Knives only” and passes

Once someone takes:

- They become the banker
- Optionally declare “going for broke”
- Take the 2 bank cards (now have 8 cards)
- Bank 2 cards face-down from their hand (back to 6 cards)
- Banked cards count toward banker's coins at the end (unless going for broke)

If someone declares “Knives only”:

- If a player declares “Knives only” and the next player takes the bank, the round is play with no strong suit
- Only knives are trump

### If Everyone Passes

If the player to the right of the dealer passes, then the dealer has three options:

1. **Take**: Become the banker
2. **Assets**: Fewest coins wins
3. **Liabilities**: Most coins wins

The round uses the strong suit (if any) named by the player to the right of the dealer

#### Assets / Liabilities

1. Dealer discards the two bank cards
2. Player left of dealer leads first trick
3. Everyone plays for themselves (no teams)
4. After last trick, count coins won
5. Assets = most coins wins, Liabilities = fewest coins wins


## The Strong Suit & Trump

- **Greater trump:** Knives (always)
- **Lesser trump:** The declared strong suit
- **Fail suits:** The other three traditional suits

### Trump Hierarchy

- Knives beat the strong suit
- The strong suit beats fail suits
- Among fail suits, only the leading suit can win the trick (unless trump is played)

### “Knives Only”

- If “Knives only” is declared, only Knives are trump
- No lesser trump exists
- All four traditional suits are fail suits


## Finding the Shadow Banker

- Player with **Ghost of the strong suit** is the shadow banker (secret partner)
- If “Knives only”: Player with **Ghost of Knives** is the shadow banker
- Identity revealed when Ghost is played
- Banker and shadow banker combine won tricks to count coins together
- If banker has the Ghost, they play solo (no partner)


## Special Card Abilities

### Ghost
- Beats King of same suit when played in same trick (except Knives, which has no King)
- Normal trump rules still apply
- Ghost of strong suit identifies the shadow banker
- If “Knives Only”: Ghost of Knives identifies the shadow banker

### Cat of Clubs
- You lead the next trick (regardless of who wins current trick)
- No effect on final (6th) trick

### Dance of Diamonds
- After playing Dance, select another player to swap cards with
- Each selects a card and exchanges face-down
- No effect on final (6th) trick

### Hound of Hearts
- After playing Hound, select another player
- They reveal one card of their choice to all players

### Snitch of Spades
- After playing Snitch, name one non-ghost card (e.g., “King of Hearts”)
- If held, that player must reveal it
