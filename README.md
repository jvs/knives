# 🗡 Knives

## A Five-Player Trick-Taking Game

Knives is a five-player trick-taking game where players compete to collect coins (points on cards). Each hand, one player becomes the banker and secretly partners with a shadow banker. The other three players are defenders trying to stop them.


## The Deck (32 cards)

### Knives Suit (8 cards)
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, Ace (highest)

- Ace is highest, 2 is lowest
- Knives are always **greater trump**

### Four Traditional Suits (24 cards)
Spades, Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts - each containing:

- Ghost, Special, Maid, Jack, Queen, King (highest)
- King is highest, Ghost is lowest
- Special cards rank between the Ghost and Maid

### Special Cards

- Clubs: Cat - Lead the next trick
- Diamonds: Dance - Swap a card with another player
- Hearts: Hound - Choose a player to reveal a card
- Spades: Snitch - Reveals a named card (except ghosts)


## Card Values (Coins)

- **Kings:** 3 coins each
- **Queens:** 2 coins each
- **Jacks:** 1 coin each
- **Ace of Knives:** 1 coin
- **All other cards:** 0 coins
- **Total in deck:** 25 coins


## Setup

1. Dealer shuffles and cards are cut
2. Deal 6 cards to each player (clockwise)
3. Deal 2 cards face-down to the bank
4. Dealer declares an initial strong suit


## Choosing the Banker

Starting with the player left of the dealer, each player either:

- **Takes:** Becomes the banker with the current strong suit
- **Passes:** Names a new strong suit (overriding the previous) and passes

Once someone takes:

- They become the banker
- Take the 2 bank cards (now have 8 cards)
- Bank 2 cards face-down from their hand (back to 6 cards)
- Banked cards count toward banker's coins at the end

### If Everyone Passes

If the player to the right of the dealer passes, then the dealer has three options:

1. **Take**: Become the banker
2. Declare a **Leaster**: Fewest coins wins
3. Declare a **Moster** Most coins wins

In each case, the round uses the strong suit named by the player to the right of the dealer

#### Leaster / Moster

1. Dealer discards the two bank cards
2. Player left of dealer leads first trick
3. Everyone plays for themselves (no teams)
4. After last trick, count coins won


## The Strong Suit & Trump

- **Greater trump:** Knives (always)
- **Lesser trump:** The declared strong suit
- **Fail suits:** The other three traditional suits

### Trump Hierarchy

- Knives beat the strong suit
- The strong suit beats fail suits
- Among fail suits, only the leading suit can win the trick (unless trump is played)


## Finding the Shadow Banker

- Player with **Ghost of the strong suit** is the shadow banker (secret partner)
- Identity revealed when Ghost is played
- Banker may announce playing solo (but this helps defenders)
- Banker and shadow banker combine won tricks to count coins together
- If banker has the Ghost, they play solo (no partner)


## Special Card Abilities

### Ghost
- Beats King of same suit when played in same trick
- Normal trump rules still apply
- Ghost of strong suit identifies the shadow banker

### Cat of Clubs
- You lead the next trick (regardless of who wins current trick)
- No effect on final (6th) trick

### Dance of Diamonds
- After playing Dance, select another player to swap cards with
- Each selects a card and exchanges face-down
- No effect on final (6th) trick

### Hound of Hearts
- Select another player
- They reveal one card of their choice to all players

### Snitch of Spades
- Name one non-ghost card (e.g., "King of Hearts")
- If held, that player must reveal it


## Playing Tricks

### First Lead

- **With banker:** Player left of banker leads
- **Leaster/Moster:** Player left of dealer leads
- May lead with any card

### Following Suit

- Otherwise play any card

### Winning Tricks
