## A Five-Player Trick-Taking Game

Knives is a five-player trick-taking game where players compete to collect coins (points on cards). Each hand, one player becomes the banker and secretly partners with a shadow banker. The other three players are defenders trying to stop them.


## The Deck (32 cards)

### Knives Suit (8 cards)
Ghost, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Ace (highest)

- Ace is highest, Ghost is lowest
- Knives are always **greater trump**

### Four Traditional Suits (24 cards)
Spades, Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts - each containing:

- Ghost, Prank, Maid, Jack, Queen, King (highest)
- King is highest, Ghost is lowest

### Prank Cards

Each Prank card has a special effect.

- Clubs, "The Cat": Lead the next trick
- Diamonds, "The Dance": Swap a card with another player
- Hearts, "The Hound": Choose a player to reveal a card
- Spades, "The Snitch": Reveals a named card (except ghosts)


## Card Values (Coins)

- **Kings:** 3 coins each
- **Queens:** 2 coins each
- **Jacks:** 1 coin each
- **Ace of Knives:** 1 coin
- **All other cards:** 0 coins
- **Total in deck:** 25 coins


## Setup

1. Dealer shuffles and cards are cut
2. Deal 6 cards to each player (clockwise)
3. Deal 2 cards face-down to the bank
4. Dealer declares an initial strong suit (or declares "Knives only")
5. Dealer rotates clockwise after each hand


## Choosing the Banker

Starting with the player left of the dealer, each player either:

- **Takes the bank:** Becomes the banker with the current strong suit (if any)
- **Names a suit:** Names a new strong suit OR declares "Knives only" and passes to the next player

Once someone takes the bank:

- They become the banker
- Optionally declare "going for broke" (before looking at bank cards)
- Take the 2 bank cards (now have 8 cards)
- Bank 2 cards face-down from their hand (back to 6 cards)
- Banked cards count toward banker's coins at the end (unless going for broke)

If someone declares "Knives only":

- If a player declares "Knives only" and the next player takes the bank, the round is play with no strong suit
- Only knives are trump

### If Everyone Passes

If the player to the right of the dealer passes, then the dealer has three options:

1. **Take the bank**: Become the banker
2. Declare **Assets**: Most coins wins
3. Declare **Debts**: Fewest coins wins

The round uses the strong suit named by the player to the right of the dealer

#### Assets / Debts

1. Dealer discards the two bank cards
2. Player left of dealer leads first trick
3. Everyone plays for themselves (no teams)
4. After last trick, count coins taken
5. Assets = most coins wins, Debts = fewest coins wins


## The Strong Suit & Trump

- **Greater trump:** Knives (always)
- **Lesser trump:** The declared strong suit
- **Fail suits:** The other three traditional suits

### Trump Hierarchy

- Knives beat the strong suit
- The strong suit beats fail suits
- Among fail suits, only the leading suit can win the trick (unless trump is played)

### "Knives only"

- If "Knives only" is declared, only Knives are trump
- No lesser trump exists
- All four traditional suits are fail suits


## Finding the Shadow Banker

- Player with **Ghost of the strong suit** is the shadow banker (secret partner)
- If "Knives only": Player with **Ghost of Knives** is the shadow banker
- Identity revealed when Ghost is played
- Banker and shadow banker combine won tricks to count coins together
- If banker has the Ghost, they play solo (no partner)


## Prank Cards

### Clubs, "The Cat"
- You lead the next trick (regardless of who wins current trick)

### Diamonds, "The Dance"
- Upon playing this card, select another player to swap cards with
- Each selects a card from their hand and exchanges them face-down
- Both players add the received card to their hand immediately

### Hearts, "The Hound"
- Upon playing Hound, select another player
- They show one card of their choice to all players (keeping it in hand)

### Spades, "The Snitch"
- Upon playing this card, name one non-ghost card (e.g., "King of Hearts")
- If held, that player must show it to all players (keeping it in hand)

### Timing
- Pranks take effect when played (before trick resolution), except Cat which affects who leads the next trick
- Prank cards have no effect on the final (6th) trick


## Playing Tricks

### First Lead
