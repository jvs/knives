# 🗡️ Knives

## A Five-Player Trick-Taking Game

Knives is a five-player trick-taking game where players compete to collect stars (points on cards). One player becomes the banker and secretly partners with a shadow banker. The other three players are defenders trying to stop them.


## The Deck (32 cards)

### Knives Suit (7 cards)
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Ace

- Ace is highest, 2 is lowest
- Knives are always **greater trump**

### Four Traditional Suits (24 cards)
Spades, Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts - each containing:

- Ghost (lowest)
- Thief
- Maid
- Jack
- Queen
- King (highest)

### Special Card
- 1 Joker (no suit)


## Card Values (Stars)

- **Kings:** 3 stars each
- **Queens:** 2 stars each
- **Jacks:** 1 star each
- **Ace of Knives:** 1 star
- **All other cards:** 0 stars
- **Total in deck:** 25 stars


## Setup

1. **Dealer shuffles** and cards are cut
2. **Deal 6 cards** to each player (clockwise)
3. **Deal 2 cards** face-down to the bank
4. **Dealer declares** an initial strong suit


## Choosing the Banker

Starting with the player left of the dealer, each player in turn either:

- **Picks:** Becomes the banker with the current strong suit
- **Passes:** Names a new strong suit (overriding the previous one) and passes

Once someone picks:

- They become the **banker**
- They take the 2 bank cards (now have 8 cards)
- They **bank** 2 cards face-down from their hand (back to 6 cards)
- The banked cards count toward the banker's stars at the end

### If Everyone Passes

1. The last player names a final strong suit
2. The dealer chooses **leaster** (fewest stars wins) or **moster** (most stars wins)
3. The dealer discards the 2 bank cards face-down
4. (Optional) The dealer may reveal the discarded cards (both, one, or neither)
5. All players play for themselves


## The Strong Suit & Trump

- **Greater trump:** Knives (always)
- **Lesser trump:** The declared strong suit
- **Fail suits:** The other three traditional suits

### Trump Hierarchy

- Knives beat the strong suit
- The strong suit beats fail suits
- Among fail suits, only the leading suit can win the trick (unless trump is played)


## Finding the Shadow Banker

- If a player other than the banker holds the **Ghost of the strong suit**, they are the **shadow banker** (secret partner)
- The shadow banker's identity is discovered during play when the Ghost is revealed
- The banker may announce they are playing solo if they wish, but this helps the defenders
- The banker and shadow banker **combine their won tricks** to count stars together at the end of the round
- If the banker has the Ghost, they play solo (no partner)


## Special Card Abilities

### Joker

- Can be played at any time (no need to follow suit)
- Always wins the trick
- When led: The trick has no leading suit, all players may play any card

### Ghost

- If a Ghost and King of the **same suit** are played in the same trick, the Ghost outranks the King
- The Ghost of the strong suit identifies the shadow banker

### Thief

- If you play a Thief and **no other player** plays a Thief that trick, you lead the next trick (regardless of who won)
- If multiple Thieves are played, they cancel each other out
- Has no effect on the final (6th) trick


## Playing Tricks

### First Lead

- **With a banker:** Player to the left of the banker leads
- **Leaster/Moster:** Player to the left of the dealer leads

### Following Suit

- Players must follow the leading suit if able
- If unable, they may play any card

### Winning Tricks

- Highest trump card wins (Knives beat strong suit)
- If no trump, highest card of the leading suit wins
- Exception: Joker always wins
